# Image Creation, Management, and Registry


## 1. Describe Dockerfile options [add, copy, volumes, expose, entrypoint, etc)
- *FROM:*   initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions
- *ENV:*  Sets environment variables that are visible in later build steps as well as during container runtime.
- *RUN:*  Executes a command and commits the result to the image file system.
- *CMD:*  Sets the default command for containers, and this gets overridden if a command gets specified at container runtime.
- *ENTRYPOINT:*  Sets the default executable for containers. This can still be overridden at container runtime, but requires a special flag. When ENTRYPOINT and CMD are both used, ENTRYPOINT sets the default executable, and CMD sets default arguments.
EXPOSE: Documents ports that are intended to be published at runtime.
Note: that this does not actually publish the ports.
- *WORKDIR:* Sets the working directory, both for subsequent build steps and for the container at runtime. We can use WORKDIR multiple times. If the WORKDIR begins with a forward slash /, then it will set an absolute path. Otherwise, it will set the working directory relative to the previous working directory.
- *COPY:* Copies files from the build host into the image file system.
- *ADD:* Copies files from the build host into the image file system. Unlike COPY, ADD can also extract an archive into the image file system and add files from a remote URL.
- *STOPSIGNAL:* Sets a custom signal that will be used to stop the container process.
- *HEALTHCHECK:* Sets a command that will be used by the Docker daemon to check whether the container is healthy.
